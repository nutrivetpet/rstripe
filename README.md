The goal of rstripe is to interact with the [Stripe
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api), from R.

It is an independent, community-developed R package for
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) (not created by or affiliated with
Stripe).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rstripe like so:

``` r
pak::pak("nutrivetpet/rstripe")
```

## Example

Fetch all charges:

``` r
library(rstripe)
dat <- list_charges("test", limit = Inf)
```
