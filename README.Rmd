The goal of striper is to interact with the [Stripe API](https://docs.stripe.com/api), from R.

It is an independent, community-developed R package for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) (not created by or affiliated with Stripe).

## Installation

You can install the development version of striper like so:

``` r
pak::pak("nutrivetpet/striper")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(striper)
```
